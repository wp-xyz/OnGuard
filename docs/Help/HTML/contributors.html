<p>The original project, v1.13, was open sourced by Turbo Power on 2003-Jan-07.</p>
<p>They released the help files, but not the help source, on 2003-Jan-21.</p>
<p>Packages for Delphi 3 through 7 and BCB 3 through 6 were available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On 2009-Sep-29 Nick Hodges announces he has taken over the tpsfadmin account at Sourceforge.net.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On 2009-Jan-09 support for Delphi 2009 was released on Songbeamer (<a href="http://www.songbeamer.com/delphi/" target="_blank" class="weblink">http://www.songbeamer.com/delphi/</a> ) .</p>
<p>This was based on the CVS files at Sourceforge.net.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Roman Kassebaum imported the files from CVS into SVN on 2009-Dec-16.</p>
<p>The package files for Delphi 2009 and 2010 were added by Roman Kassebaum on 2009-Dec-16. (r2, r3, r4)</p>
<p>He also changed the version number to 1.14 but only for these packages.</p>
<p>On 2009-Dec-20 Roman made some PAsniChar to PChar changes. (r6)</p>
<p>On 2009-Dec-21 Roman made some more PAnsiChar to PChar changes. (r7)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On 2009-Dec-23 support for Delphi 2010 was released on Songbeamer (<a href="http://www.songbeamer.com/delphi/" target="_blank" class="weblink">http://www.songbeamer.com/delphi/</a> ) .</p>
<p>This was based on Roman's changes at Sourceforge.net.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On 2013-Oct-05 Roman Kassebaum announces he is now in control of the tpsfadmin account at Sourceforge.net.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On 2013-Dec-26 Andrew Haines announces (via Roman's blog) he has added Roman to the CLX fork as an admin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On 2013-Dec-29 Andrew Haines requests access to the OnGuard project at Sourceforge.net.</p>
<p>On 2013-Dec-31 Roman adds Andrew to the developer group with access to the SVN code only.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting 2014-Jan-06 Andrew Haines initiated a merge of the 1.13 and 1.14 versions along with the Songbeamer fork, the Lazarus fork, and the CLX fork.</p>
<p>This was done to consolidate the changes made in each fork back into the original project.</p>
<p>At this time packages for Delphi XE through XE5 were added along with the CLX and Lazarus packages. (r9)</p>
<p>Unit tests were added to confirm the API functionality against the original 1.13 version. (r9)</p>
<p>Original help file imported into a Help &amp; Manual project. (r9)</p>
<p>Examples for Lazarus and CLX added. (r10)</p>
<p>Original PDF manual added. (r11)</p>
<p>CHM, HxS, and HTML versions of documentation added. (r11)</p>
<p>Support for an Unlimited Usage code was added (Feature request 5). (r12)</p>
<p>Bug reports 6, 7, 8, and 10 were fixed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PurePascal versions of Min, Max, RolX, and XorMem were added 2015-Jan-09. (r13)</p>
<p>These were merged from the Lazarus fork.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The old G113 and G114 packages were removed on 2014-Jan-14. (r14)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On 2014-Apr-11 support for OSX was added. (r15)</p>
<p>This included the first attempts at porting to FireMonkey (a.k.a. FMX).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On 2014-Jun-28 the tpsfadmin user removed Andrew Haines from the Admin role on the CLX fork.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On 2015-Jan-15 Roman Kassebaum forks the code to Github ( <a href="http://github.com/TurboPack-XE8/" target="_blank" class="weblink">http://github.com/TurboPack-XE8/</a> ).</p>
<p>Here he splits the project into two forks for VCL and FMX.</p>
<p>Both projects only support XE8, all other environments are removed.</p>
<p>He forks these projects again &nbsp;( <a href="http://github.com/TurboPack/" target="_blank" class="weblink">http://github.com/TurboPack/</a> ) to support the current Delphi product: Delphi 10 Seattle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On 2015-Jan-22 Marco Cantu contacts Andrew Haines to initiate a conversation regarding the status of the OnGuard library and &quot;cleaning it up&quot;.</p>
<p>Andrew replied stating that he uses the library on Windows and Linux with Delphi 6, 2006, XE5, XE7, Kylix 3, and Lazarus and while he had experimented with FireMonkey it was a low priority. &nbsp;The backward compatibility and multi-environment support were more important than current Delphi language features.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On 2015-Feb-15 support for Delphi XE6 and XE7 was added. (r16)</p>
<p>Fixes for mismatched IF/IFEND were committed. (r17)</p>

<p>IFDEFs in ogproexe were cleaned up.</p>
<p>Warnings added for unsupported platforms added to ogproexe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On 2015-Dec-06 it was asked in the ThirdParty.General newsgroup if OnGuard supported 64-bit.</p>
<p>Andrew Haines replied that it did not but he would add it to the list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On 2015-Dec-07 support for XE8 and Delphi 10 Seattle was added. (r20)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On 2015-Dec-10 FMX support for Delphi 10 Seattle was added. (r23)</p>
